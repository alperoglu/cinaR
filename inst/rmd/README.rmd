`cinaR` is a single wrapper function for end-to-end computational analyses of 
bulk ATAC-seq profiles. It starts from a consensus peak file and outputs
Differentially Accessible (DA) peaks with corresponding genenames,
adjusted p-values, log-fold changes and so on.

<br/>

## Installation

```{r eval=FALSE}
library(devtools)
install_github("eonurk/cinaR")
```


## Quick Start

```{r}
library(cinaR)
data("atac_seq_consensus_bm")
```

Bed formatted consensus matrix (chr, start, end and samples)
```{r}
dim(bed)
```


```{r}
# bed formatted file
head(bed[,1:4])
```

Create the contrasts you want to compare, here we create contrasts for 
22 mice samples from different strains.
```{r}
# create contrast vector which will be compared.
contrasts<- c("B6", "B6", "B6", "B6", "B6", "NZO", "NZO", "NZO", "NZO", "NZO", "NZO", 
              "B6", "B6", "B6", "B6", "B6", "NZO", "NZO", "NZO", "NZO", "NZO", "NZO")
```

`cinaR` function directly computes the differentially accessible peaks.
```{r cache=TRUE}
# If reference genome is not set hg38 will be used!
results <- cinaR(bed, contrasts, reference.genome = "mm10")
```

There are many information `cinaR` provides such as adjusted p value, 
log fold-changes, gene names etc.
```{r}
# B6 vs NZO
colnames(results$B6_NZO)
```

Here is an overview of the result:
```{r }
head(results$B6_NZO[,1:5])
```


## Creating different contrasts

Note that you can further divide the resolution of contrasts, for instance this
is also a valid vector
```{r}
contrasts <- sapply(strsplit(colnames(bed), split = "-", fixed = T), 
                    function(x){paste(x[1:4], collapse = "-")})[4:25]
unique(contrasts)
```
in this case, each of them will be compared to each other which will result in
28 different comparisons.

## Selecting different reference genomes
For now, `cinaR` supports 3 genomes,for human and mice models:

- `hg38`
- `hg19`
- `mm10`

You can set your it using `reference.genome` argument.

## Batch Effect Correction
If you suspect your data have unknown batch effects, you can use:
```{r eval=FALSE}
cinaR(..., batch.correction = T)
```
This option will run [Surrogate Variable Analysis](http://bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/html/sva.html) (SVA) and try to
adjust your data for unknown batch effects. If however, you already know the batches of the samples, you can simply set the `batch.information` argument as well:

```{r eval=FALSE}
# batch information should be number a vector where
# the length of it equals to the number of samples.
cinaR(..., batch.correction = T, batch.information = c(rep(0, 11), rep(1,11)))
```
> Reminder - In our example data we have 22 samples
  
## Saving DA peaks to excel

Setting `save.DA.peaks = TRUE` in `cinaR` function will create a `DApeaks.xlsx` file
in the current directory. This file includes all the comparisons in different tabs.
Additionally, you can set the path/name of the file using 
`DA.peaks.path` argument after setting `save.DA.peaks = TRUE`.

For instance, 

```{r eval=FALSE}
results <- cinaR(..., save.DA.peaks = T, DA.peaks.path = "./Peaks_mice.xlsx")
```

will create an excel file with name `Peaks_mice.xlsx` in the current directory.

## Using different GLM algorithms
Currently, `cinaR` supports 4 different algorithms, namely; 

- edgeR
- limma-voom
- limma-trend
- DESeq2

If not set, it uses `edgeR` for differential analyses. 
You can change the used algorithm by simply setting `DA.choice` argument.
For more information, `?cinaR`

## Contribution

You can send pull requests to make your contributions.

I occasionally mess up, so all comments are appreciated!

## Future work
- Add enrichment pipeline
  - hyper-geometric p-value
  - geneset enrichment analyses
  - make it compitable with `.gmt` format
