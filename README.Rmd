## Overview
`cinaR` is a single wrapper function for end-to-end computational analyses of 
bulk ATAC-seq profiles. It starts from a consensus peak file and outputs
Differentially Accessible (DA) peaks and Enrichment Analyses results.

## Installation

```{r eval=FALSE}
library(devtools)
install_github("eonurk/cinaR")
```

## Quick Start
```{r}
library(cinaR)
data("atac_seq_consensus_bm")

contrasts<- c("B6", "B6", "B6", "B6", "B6", "NZO", "NZO", "NZO", "NZO", "NZO", "NZO", 
              "B6", "B6", "B6", "B6", "B6", "NZO", "NZO", "NZO", "NZO", "NZO", "NZO")

results <- cinaR(bed, contrasts, reference.genome = "mm10")
```

```{r}
pca_plot(results, contrasts, show.names = F)
```

```{r}
heatmap_plot(results)
```


```{r}
dot_plot(results)
```


## Contribution

You can send pull requests to make your contributions.

I occasionally mess up, so all comments are appreciated!

## Future work
1. ~~Add enrichment pipeline~~
  + ~~hyper-geometric p-value~~
  + ~~geneset enrichment analyses~~
  + ~~make it compitable with `.gmt` format~~

2. Visualization of Enrichment Results
  + ~~Dot plot~~
  + Network plot

3. Small improvements
  + save enrichment files to excel
  + ~~make SV number an argument~~
  + pass `...` into several functions
